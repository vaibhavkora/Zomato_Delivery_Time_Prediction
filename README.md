# Zomato Delivery Time Prediction


# 📝Description
This project predicts the estimated delivery time for Zomato food orders using machine learning techniques. It processes historical order data, extracts features, and builds predictive models to estimate delivery times based on various factors such as restaurant location, distance, and traffic conditions.

# 📊Data and Model Training
- The dataset is processed and analyzed in Deliverytime_zomato.ipynb.
- The model is trained using regression techniques to predict delivery time.

# 🛠Technologies Used
- Python 🐍
- Jupyter Notebook 📓
- Pandas, NumPy for data processing
- Scikit-Learn for machine learning
- Matplotlib, Seaborn for visualization

  # 🎯Usage
- Load the dataset in notebooks/
- Run data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training
- Evaluate the model and analyze the results
